<h2 align="center">I'm Herik, a mobile developer from Brazil</h2>
<br/>
<div align="center">
Graduated as an IT Technician with a focus on systems development, expected to complete my Computer Science degree in 2025.
I am an enthusiast of Clean Architecture principles, such as the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and the Open/Closed Principle. I constantly seek to deepen my understanding of Clean Code to develop orthogonal software independent of the tool used. During my technical course, I acquired solid experience in Java, applying the MVC architecture and object-oriented programming concepts.
In the last 2 years, I have developed several personal and professional projects using Flutter, always prioritizing best programming practices.
I have an advanced level of English and am in the process of perfecting my fluency through classes with native speakers. I aim to work as a full-stack software developer, using my technical skills and knowledge of Clean Architecture to create innovative and high-quality solutions.
