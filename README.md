<h2 align="center">I'm Herik, a mobile developer from Brazil</h2>
<br/>
<div align="center">
I've always been fascinated by technology, video games, and stories. As a child, I loved playing my Nintendo, listening to artists like Linkin Park, and reading fantasy books. These passions led me to become curious—a trait I consider my best skill.

After completing my minor in System Development at CEFET-MG, a federal college in Brazil, I began learning more about software best practices. My goal was to excel in programming beyond just coding in a specific language—at that time, I focused on Java. Currently, I'm majoring in Computer Science, paying much more attention to computing fundamentals and core concepts. Additionally, over the past two years, I've been carving a path in mobile development with Flutter, preparing myself to start my career as a developer.

I know I still have a long way to go, but curiosity is something I'll never lack.
